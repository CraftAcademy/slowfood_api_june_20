## Authors

## The challenge
Build an online food ordering system (with accompanying [Client](https://github.com/Alex-Bellamy/slowfood_client_june_20)). An e-commerce web-based app that allows customers to order their food for home delivery, or for pick up from the restaurant. Our imaginary client is a restaurant owner that needs a website where he can list his menu and allow visitors to place orders.

## Scope 
In the first version of the application we focussed on the following functionality:
```
- A menu needs to consist of many dishes
- Each dish has/belongs to a Category. It is either a 'starter', 'main course' or 'dessert'
- Visitors to the site can add various products to their order
- To create an order and check out, a customer needs to become a registered user
- Order need to calculate a total price
```

## Skills practised
- Agile methods for software development
- Working and self-organising in teams
- Pair Programming 
- Collaboration using Git and GitHub
- Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Design or Acceptance - Unit Test cycle
- Using Pivotal Tracker's project management tool, user stories and lo-fi's
- Iterative and incremental design
- The importance of planning work
- Learn about Ruby on Rails as an API (Understand the concept of ORM's vs SQL (ActiveRecord), the MVC structure, controllers, routes, models, relation between models and the concept of params)
- Delve deeper into React
- Understand how to consume an API and the different requests 
- How a React client fits into the MVC structure
- User Authentication
- Reading the documentation for libraries we use in our projects (gems & packages)
- Debugging and problem-solving skills

## Tech and packages
- Rails API
- React client
- Pivotal Tracker as Project Management tool for tracking features, chores and bugs
- PostgreSQL as a database with ActiveRecord as ORM
- Cypress for acceptance testing in React
- RSpec for Unit & Request tests
- Devise for user authentication and account management
